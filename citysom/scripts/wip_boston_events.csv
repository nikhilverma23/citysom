op,Eric Mauro: at ease Art Exhibit,,Athans Bakery Gallery,407 Washington St,"Brighton, MA 02135",0,"For its fall art exhibition in Brighton, Athans Caf Art Gallery, one of the best venues for contemporary art in Greater Boston, proudly presents: Eric Mauro: at ease, a solo exhibition of 32 recent lush and vibrant oil paintings by Boston artist Eric Mauro. This exhibition is a contrast between how youth allow their lives to effortlessly unfold at ease with mental and physical calmness and serenity while many adults continue to struggle with pain, worry and stress. The public opening wine reception is Sunday, September 9 from 6:00-8:00 pm and an Artist Talk Back at 6:30 pm. The exhibition concludes on October 31. All of the paintings on exhibit can be purchased at the opening reception and throughout the exhibition run.  Athans, which has  been exhibiting some of the top regional artists at both of its locations for the past year, is located at 407 Washington St. in Historic Brighton Center and is open everyday from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm.Youthful inhibition gradually dissipates for most as they assume adulthood and acquire more responsibilities.  But even as peace and tranquility deteriorate and stress, habits and anxiety are enhanced, adults oftentimes continue to search for the well-being and comfort of their youthful days.  Erics paintings are an entry point for both youth and adults to contemplate a life at ease.In this exhibition, Eric Mauro attempts to turn memories or feelings into paintings, and what he has discovered is that the ones that work best are those with exuberant or expressive visual activity. While his hometown of Brighton does not have majestic views and spectacular landscapes, he is still moved to create people he meets in the spaces he views them. Though art is primarily a solitary effort, he can usually spot and retain visions that combine an active landscape, bodily effort, and a story of a difficult or strenuous creation, even if that creation is on the part of plants or rocks.Erics art is one of changing styles and striving for new ways to turn up the volume in his paintings. Everything he has painted comes from nature in the broad sense, but he sees paintings not as copies but as pieces that have their own strength to express the forces of nature.  He spent years creating the best landscapes he could, including copying from Dutch and other masters in the Museum of Fine Arts. Low-relief sculptures gave him the ability to break away from simply expressing the vastness of space to concentrate on figures and the air around and along them, and the freedom to invent movement and expression.  The painter that currently influences Eric the most is Maurice Denis, a French member of the Nabis group from the 1890s.  Denis combination of figures and brilliantly colored landscapes, as well as ornamental patterns, correspond to many of Mauros own formal training and interests.  The figures themselves, however, depart from Denis in favor of the work of Honor Daumier for Daumiers reading of posture and expression.  This is where Eric is now with his art -- developing a feel for the figures in his paintings and the freedom to paint them. But it would not have happened without the story of youth and growth that is around him everyday in his neighborhood of Brighton.",,Exhibition,,All public,www.archivalexhibitions.com,openhour_based,24/10/2012,31/10/2012,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,,,,,,,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,,,,,,,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,,,,,,,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,EricMauro.jpg,,,,,,,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,,,,,,,08:00:00,22:00:00,08:00:00,22:00:00,08:00:00,22:00:00,08:00:00,22:00:00,08:00:00,22:00:00,08:00:00,22:00:00,08:00:00,22:00:00

Lewis novel about spiritual warfare from a demons point of view, will return to Boston by popular demand for three performances only.  The limited engagement will run at the Cutler Majestic Theatre at Emerson College, 219 Tremont Street in Boston, Friday November 30 and Saturday, December 1.  THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS performed to sell out houses previously at the Cutler Majestic Theatre in December of 2011.The National Tour of THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS kicked off after a hit nine-month run at the Westside Theatre in New York City where it entertained 50,000 theatergoers.  Prior to that, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS was a sold out hit in Chicago and Washington D. C. where it ran for a combined eight months.Now in its second smash year, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS National Tour has delighted capacity audiences in 50 major cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Orlando, Seattle and Houston.   Over 200,000 have seen this production on tour, which continues to attract a national following.<br />Associated Press calls THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS Devilishly funny! The Chicago Sun-Times hails the production as Smart, sizzling entertainment! The Boston Globe raves that it is Engrossing and Entertaining! and The Chicago Tribune says THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is Very smart...richly rewarding...exuberant theatricality!  <br />THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS creates a topsy-turvy morally inverted universe set in an eerily stylish office in hell, where God is called the Enemy and the devil is referred to as Our Father below.  The play follows His Abysmal Sublimity Screwtape, Satans top psychiatrist (due to his profound understanding of human nature), and his slavish creature-demon Toadpipe, as they train an apprentice demon, Wormwood, on how to ruin the life and damn the soul of an unsuspecting human on earth.  Screwtape is played by award-winning actor Max McLean.Along with The Chronicles of Narnia (including The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe), The Great Divorce and Mere Christianity, THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is still one of Lewis most popular and influential works.  The books piercing insight into human nature and the lucid and humorous way Lewis makes his readers squirm in self-recognition made it an immediate success.  When first published in 1942 it brought worldwide fame to this little-known Oxford don including the cover of Time Magazine.The idea for Screwtape first came to Lewis after listening to Hitlers Reichstag Speech on July 19, 1940, while it was simultaneously translated on BBC Radio.  Lewis wrote I dont know if Im weaker than other people, but it is a positive revelation to me how while the speech lasts it is impossible not to waver just a little Statements which I know to be untrue all but convince meif only the man says them unflinchingly.Lewis dedicated it to his close friend J. R. R. Tolkien who had expressed to Lewis that delving too deeply into the craft of evil would have consequences.  Lewis admitted as much when he wrote Though I had never written anything more easily, I never wrote with less enjoyment . . . though it was easy to twist ones mind into the diabolical attitude, it was not fun, or not for long. The work into which I had to project myself while I spoke through Screwtape was all dust, grit, thirst, and itch. Every trace of beauty, freshness, and geniality had to be excluded.THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS is produced by New York City based Fellowship for the Performing Arts. Max McLean serves as Artistic Director.  Executive Producer and General Manager is Ken Denison of Aruba Productions.

Backed by a large student ensemble, the Grammy- and Latin Grammy Award-winning artist will perform some of his biggest hits at Berklee College of Music on Nov. 8.Luis Enrique Meets Berklee is part of Berklees Signature Music Series and Latin Music and Culture Celebration. It takes place on Thursday, Nov. 8, 8:15 p.m. at the Berklee Performance Center (BPC), 136 Massachusetts Avenue, Boston. Tickets are reserved seating, $8, $16 (advance) and $12, $22 (day of show). Purchase tickets at berkleebpc.com, by calling 617 747-2261, or visit the BPC Box Office. The venue is wheelchair-accessible. The concert is produced by bass professor Oscar Stagnaro, with Matthew Nicholl, Berklees chair of contemporary writing and production, serving musical director.Luis Enrique pioneered a smooth, emotive brand of salsa that paved the way for other successful Latin pop artists, such as Marc Anthony and Victor Manuelle. A native of Managua, Nicaragua, he immigrated to Los Angeles in 1978. Inspired by American jazz and R&B, and excited to grow musically, he began incorporating new sounds into his music. After an audition for a local salsa group, he made such an impression on the bands producers that they took him into a studio to record a demo. That recording led to a deal with Sony in 1987 for the release of his debut album Amor de Media Noche.After establishing himself as one of the most successful and influential artists in salsa, Luis Enrique took a nine-year recording hiatus. He returned to the forefront of Latin American music with the release of the 2009 album Ciclos and last years Soy Y Sere, which received a 2012 Latin Grammy nomination for Best Salsa Album. His sizable discography has earned him a Grammy Award, two Latin Grammy Awards, five Lo Nuestro Awards, four Latin Billboard Awards, as well as several gold and platinum records.Luis Enrique has also become a forceful figure in the struggle for immigrant rights. He recently participated in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, where he had the opportunity to meet President Obama, and express his thoughts on the Dream Act and the importance of immigration reform.For more information on Luis Enrique, visit luisenriquemusic.com.",,Concert,,All public,,performance_based,08/11/2012,08/11/2012,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,20:15:00,22:15:00,,,,,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,,,,,,,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,,,,,,,,,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,citysom_logo_email.png,,,,,,,08/11/2012,08/11/2012,ONCE,1,,1,Monday,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
